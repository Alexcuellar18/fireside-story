    <h1>Fireside Story</h1>
    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p> And the night was cold.</p>
    <p>Not a cloud was in the sky, so you could see all of the stars above.<br>
    What a pretty night I said to myself!</p>

    <p>The calm was soon interrupted by a bear that came out of the woods!!</p>
